<p>
This newsgroup is for discussion of issues affecting owners and intending
owners of businesses in Australia. Examples of on-topic discussions
include:
 <ul>
  <li>ASIC requirements,
  <li>Changes to government policy, regulation and taxation,
  <li>National business infrastructure,
  <li>How to manage Australian employees, and,
  <li>Any other issue which affects businesses and startups.
 </ul>
</p>

<p>
Some caveats for online behaviour exist:
</p>

<ul>
 <li>aus.business is a text-only discussion group. If what you have to
 say absolutely requires HTML, text encoding or binaries, posters should
 direct their potential readers to a URL which contains these things.

 <li>Advertising is not allowed in the body of messages to this newsgroup
 (Use the aus.ads.* hierarchy instead if you absolutely must). A standard
 four line .signature has more than enough room to alert readers to your
 company and its services.

 <li>Be aware that some participants will consider aus.business more
 "real world" than others. The onus is on aus.business users to recognise
 that libel laws exist. Ad hominem attacks are discouraged.

 <li>Crossposting to the more flame-filled newsgroups (eg, aus.politics
 et al) is also discouraged.

</ul>

<p>
aus.business explicitly welcomes the use of binary message cancelers and
anti-spam cancelers which apply a Breidbart Index threshold of 3. Info
on how the BI is calculated is in the "Breidbart Index (BI) Definition"
